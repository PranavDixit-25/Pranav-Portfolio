# 🚀 Firebase Hosting Setup Guide for Your Portfolio Website

## Overview
This guide will help you deploy your portfolio website to Firebase Hosting - Google's fast, secure, and free web hosting service. You'll get a professional URL and automatic SSL certificate!

## ✅ What You Get with Firebase Hosting
- **Free hosting** with 1GB storage and 10GB bandwidth per month

## 📋 Prerequisites
- Your portfolio website files (index.html, style.css, app.js)
- A Gmail account for Firebase
- Node.js installed on your computer

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Install Node.js (if not already installed)
1. Go to https://nodejs.org
2. Download and install the LTS version
3. Verify installation by opening terminal/command prompt and typing:
   ```
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

### Step 2: Install Firebase CLI

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

### Step 3: Create Firebase Project

2. Click "Add project"
3. Enter project name (e.g., "pranav-portfolio")
4. Disable Google Analytics (not needed for hosting)
5. Click "Create project"

### Step 4: Set Up Your Website Files
1. Create a new folder on your computer (e.g., "my-portfolio")
2. Copy your website files (index.html, style.css, app.js) into this folder
3. Open terminal/command prompt in this folder

### Step 5: Login to Firebase
In your terminal, run:
```bash
firebase login
```
This will open your browser - sign in with your Gmail account

### Step 6: Initialize Firebase Project
In your website folder, run:
```bash
firebase init hosting
```

Follow the prompts:
- **Select a Firebase project**: Choose the project you created in Step 3
- **Public directory**: Type "." (dot) to use current folder
- **Single-page app**: Type "N" (No)
- **Overwrite index.html**: Type "N" (No)

### Step 7: Deploy Your Website

```bash
firebase deploy
```

🎉 **Success!** Your website is now live! Firebase will show you two URLs:

## 🌐 Optional: Add Custom Domain

### If You Want Your Own Domain (like pranavdixit.com):

2. **Add custom domain in Firebase**:
   - Go to Firebase Console → Hosting
   - Click "Add custom domain"

3. **Update DNS records**:
   - Go to your domain provider's DNS settings
   - Add the A records that Firebase shows you
   - Wait 24-48 hours for propagation

4. **Get free SSL certificate**:
   - Firebase automatically provides SSL after DNS verification
   - Your site will be accessible via https://yourdomain.com
